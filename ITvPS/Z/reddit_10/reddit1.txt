If this is one of them, we will get things passed for years to come. The Republicans weren't the only ones to have a Southern Strategy, and Stacey Abrams has ensured that ours is able to bloom. The Republicans' fear of what that means is both well-founded and delicious to savor. Every drop of political capital spent on a voting rights act that tightens the noose on Red states strangling our voters is well spent many times over, because the we have no need to seek Republican consent, we are capable of wielding power under our own numbers.

Saying this as one of the out conservatives on reddit: literally nothing bad can happen with more people voting.

Our voter turnout is dismal. Democracy, and the success of our very republic, relies on two things: voters voting, and the constraint of the power of the federal government. We need to increase both.

They've been pushing "voter ID" for more than a decade. It would be great if we helped ALL Americans get proper IDs and their backup paperwork. Not having this stuff hugely disadvantages you. I honestly wonder how many people get old and don't have access to Social Security, on top of not having a bank account and thus getting shafted by check cashing bullshit.

In the preceding decade we could have been helping close to everyone get ID. Then, when everyone had it, Republicans could "secure elections blah blah." But Republicans haven't made any effort that I can see to help everyone get ID. I wonder why?

I can't believe those rat fucks are actually publicly attempting to justify it or make it seem like we're making shit up. It's public knowledge that they're pushing this legislation. It's public knowledge that they're trying to prevent people from handing out fucking water at already hours long voting lines. I mean how can ANYONE possibly defend that? These fucking degenerates should be hiding their heads in shame and hoping their bullshit laws slip through the cracks. It's bad enough they're doing it to begin with, but to actually speak into a microphone and pretend it's anything other than blatant voter suppression is just sickening and maddening.

They don't want FAIR Democracy because when you allow the people to vote unrestricted and in non-manipulated ways (i.e. Gerrymandering and Voter Suppression), it's clear as day who the people want leading the country. (Hint: it's not the Conservative party who's only interests are self-serving ones that keep them wealthy and in power, but rather the guys who have proven time and time again that they actually work for the People.)

If you reform how voting works and take away their ability to manipulate things to their advantage, they will no longer be a Minority Ruling party and they damn well know it.

They've been backed into a corner and are ferociously lashing out at anything that gets close to them. They've become snared and are afraid that the ship is going down while they are still tied to it. If a massive voting reform such as the one being written by Democrats passes, they can kiss their pathways to leadership goodbye. And they don't want that.

So they chose Fascism because hey, while they may be Fascists, they'll be the Fascists IN CHARGE. And that's better, in their minds, than not holding the keys.

Not the states, not for the greater good, but for what HE believes is good. I don’t know why rightists screech “DEMS ARE CHINA-COMMUNISM,” or “PUTIN LOVERS-RUSSIA” when all trump wants is exactly what happens in China and Russia, where all of the legislative body are just there for show, to push the leaders agenda and remove term limits (which was trumps ultimate goal)

Just attack her sources. That’s the only way conservatives know how to argue, and will get through to them more than refuting lies in a thoughtful way.

Tell her:

Epoch Times is owned by a Chinese cult whose leader believes he can levitate and turn invisible. Nothing they say can be trusted.

Heritage Foundation is a corporate lobby group that pushes lies to benefit corporations and screw over regular people.

ACLJ is a corrupt lobby group whose donations all get funneled to the family of Trump’s lawyer, Jay Sekulow.

Democrats began pushing on Wednesday for the most substantial expansion of voting rights in a half-century, laying the groundwork in the Senate for what would be a fundamental change to the ways voters get to the polls and elections are run.

At a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders made a passionate case for a bill that would mandate automatic voter registration nationwide, expand early and mail-in voting, end gerrymandering that skews congressional districts for maximum partisan advantage and curb the influence of money in politics.

The effort is taking shape as Republicans have introduced more than 250 bills to restrict voting in 43 states and have continued to spread false accusations of fraud and impropriety in the 2020 election. It comes just months after those claims, spread by President Donald J. Trump as he sought to cling to power, fueled a deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that showed how deeply his party had come to believe in the myth of a stolen election.

But my geotus, I wanna worship my geotus!

This is the one thing out of everything there is in regards to US elections that baffles me. As a Canadian, I’ve voted in small towns, and I’ve voted while in large cities. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes at absolute maximum to vote in any election. I think the longest time where I actually half-ass paid attention was 7 minutes between getting out of my vehicle to go in and vote, to returning back to my vehicle.

Single issue voters is the answer.

If you only care about finding ways to ban abortion, who do you vote for?

If you only care to own any gun without restrictions, who do you vote for?

If you only want to prevent immigrants from going into the country, who do you vote for?

There's a longer list, but you get the point. Millions will continue to vote for republicans at any cost so long as their issue is in their platform. And among those carefully selected issues, it's untenable for Democrats to change their position.

Remember when we look back at wars and go "why are they just standing in lines? All your guys are gonna get shot!". History is gonna look at the filibuster the same.

I believe the plan is to do a bunch of these bills that are really controversial to hate, and then when the republicans inevitably hate them, the right leaning Dems will have more ammunition to deal with the filibuster

Republicans called it a power grab that would put their party at a permanent disadvantage.

Um, if allowing people to vote, which last I checked, was the very foundation of our entire system of governance and order, then MAYBE it’s time to reevaluate your fucking party.

This is like the kid that never studies showing up on test day and saying it’s not fair he didn’t realize al this stuff would be on the test.

Or the guy that doesn’t have insurance and then totals his Mustang and then complains about the other cars on the road.

Or or or...

One thing that I feel gets overlooked in the 'automatic voter registration' feature is that voter roles is where jury pools are pulled from. This would lead to jury pools that are much more representative of the community as a whole and not just representative of the voting populous.

Biden is kicking ass... This is the best strategy. Focus on voting FIRST.

We can't get any agenda passed without having both the House and the Senate.

It also forces the Republicans to come out against voting rights.

Once we secure our democracy, all the other things we want to accomplish will happen because we'll hold the Whitehouse and Congress for the next 10-20 years.

If we DON'T that means that the GOP had to actually convince voters and earn votes which I totally support!

Interesting. Dems have some other wish list bills they want passed but are going all out on voting rights at this moment. I think this is 100% their strategy to eliminate or reform the filibuster. What a fairly non-controversial and inspiring bill to use. It’s pretty genius. One by one, Dems will fall until just Sinema and Manchin are left. Sinema will cave first based on the public outcry from her $15 no vote. Manchin will be the lone holdout until the filibuster is reformed to his approval (probably already discussed with Schumer).

This will be masterful if Schumer pulls it off. With voting rights, Dream act legalizations, and DC statehood passed, Dems are probably holding their Senate majority for awhile.

I think that they have to.

REDMAP is literally about to throw the knockout blow (with the GOP controlling the vast majority of state legislatures, and redrawing District maps this year), and the Republicans are making overtures to create legislative dominance indefinitely, nationwide, despite being a minority party (by the raw numbers).

This is literally DEFCON 1 status.

I sure hope you're right.

My prediction:

Manchin will leave the door open for Republicans to come to the table to negotiate. Republicans, if we can believe the trend, will make their usual baseless claims, grandstanding, gaslighting, etc. and Manchin will go 'Well, we tried. Amend the filibuster'.



GQP will activate their activist judges that were installed over the last ~5 years and perhaps succeed at blocking the law forcing Democrats to appeal. Rinse and repeat until it reaches the Supreme Court. Of course these GQPers and their activist judges will time this perfectly so these new rules won't be in place until after 2022 if not longer.

Re: the whole Power Grab thing. IMO there are only two options - as indicated by this article and others, the GOP is thoroughly aware that making it easier to vote will harm their chances of having maximized political power. None of the people against these changes have now or in years past (to my knowledge, if I am wrong please LMK) ever once gone on record saying something specific or concrete about So and So change is unfair, biased, unjust, etc. To me that shows they are knowingly operating in bad faith when they play the Power Grab card.

The other option, IMO, is that the person really does think it's a Power Grab, due to whatever reason. This person might be incorrect, but at least they are not operating in bad faith.

What I find disgusting about the current GOP is that all the people in power fall into that first camp, where they are intentionally and knowingly putting maintaining power ahead of having the best democracy we can. For a fucking POLITICAN to do this is the highest level of moral treason possible IMO. I call out every damn one of them as a liar, an asshole, and most of all, a shitty American.

Why would anyone support the GOP? I can think of some reasons not to:

They're attempting to restrict voting rights so certain stratas of society can't vote

They gerrymander districts because they can't win elections otherwise

They just attempted to overthrow their own government

They believe gay and trans people don't have rights

They don't support freedom of religion

They are a virtual death cult that revels in violence

They worship a man who could possibly be the most narcissistic person in history

They vehemently loathe minorities even though minorities built this country

They have no sense of humor whatsoever

Those are just a few off the top of my head. The only thing that seriously irritates me about Democrats:

Political correctness is ABSOLUTE HORSESHIT

This isn't even unique to democrats. Republicans/conservatives were just as bad about it in the 80's and 90's and to a lesser extent today. Instead of slurs and bigoted language the right didn't like it when you used profanity and was against nudity in anything.

Also, let's not forget the right-wing hate-boner for music . First it was jazz, then rock, then metal, then punk, and now it's rap.

Personally, I dislike that "political correctness" is a political thing.

Empathy and human decent shouldn't be political. Someone saying "I'm not Josh, I'm Joshua" doesn't get as many people upset the way "I'm not Steve, I'm Eve," or "My preferred pronouns are 'they'" does. Like who gives a shit if it's a "real" pronoun or not?

What's so bad about respecting someone's choice for what name they want to be called and what pronoun they want to use? What is so terrible about refusing to call COVID the "Wu Chung Flu" or whatever racist BS Trump spewed? What is so terrible about refusing to paint Asians with a broad brush, just because our government did jack all to prevent its citizens from becoming ill with a virus that originated from China? What's so terrible about refusing to paint Muslims with a broad brush because a few extremists blew up the Twin Towers? What's so terrible about pointing out "white male" is the "default" race/gender?

Political correctness is ABSOLUTE HORSESHIT.

I agree that PC is used to circumnavigate certain uncomfortable truths that would better be addressed head-on. However, there is something to be said for “Publicly Appropriate” language.

It’s one thing to be vulgar and irreverent at home, it’s another thing entirely to talk that way as President. I’m much more concerned about a narcissistic bigot in charge of major socioeconomic decisions than a gay-bashing, rape-joking film director who’s in charge of giving Chris Pratt’s shirtless chest the screentime his investors paid for.

(See, I’m vulgar and irreverent. But I’m not affecting your wallet or mental health.)

Right as the Supreme Court is challenging the voting rights act from the 60s saying it’s overreach of the federal government into elections which are constitutionally state ran.

I hugely disagree with the notion that this is true because the fundamentals of the Constitution are ensuring liberty and equality to all Americans

In a day and age where presidents are nearing closer to 80 than ever, I think the supreme court needs term limits. We don’t need to expand it, but someone like ACB (picked because of age) could easily clock in almost 40 years at the bench. Only 15 of our 115 supreme court justices served for over 30 years.

...and what red blooded American wouldn't want every citizen of this great country to have the ability to vote?

Men and women have died to protect our freedoms, they have also died for worthless causes but in the end everyone should be able to vote for what they think is best for this country.

Voting days should be celebrated in this country too, not loathed. We should all have the day off to celebrate our freedoms by making our voices heard. By walking in the streets to our polling booths, standing in line among our bothers and sisters, free from blockades, free from oppression, free from violence.

Voting should also be by sheer numbers, not false lines planted on a map. Every single ballot should be represented and not the aggressive divisions that separate neighbors from one another.

Fingers crossed. This shit should have happened long ago. The corruption, on either side, should always be struck down in favor of the right choice -the choice to make sure that every Americans voice is heard.

In the US some states have made it a requirement to have an ID, then went about making it more difficult to obtain an ID.

Also, as you have probably been seeing, conservatives in the US are making an argument in the courts to allow for voter suppression, as they cannot win elections if more people vote.

Basically, the conservative mantra right now, as it has always been, is to only allow "qualified voters" to vote. This is also known as, "only let white conservative bigots vote and no one else."
