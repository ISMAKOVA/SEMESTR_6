Conservative George W. Bush Is Now Too Liberal for His Party
By Ed Kilgore

It’s well-known that there’s no love lost between Donald J. Trump and the Bush family. They (with the exception of Texas pol George P. Bush) were conspicuously missing from the ranks of Republican leaders who happily or dutifully endorsed the mogul in 2016 or in 2020. And in a new interview with the Texas Tribune, the 43rd president makes it abundantly clear he is miles away from the 45th on a wide range of issues. But he also shows he’s far from the prevailing mood in the party he led for eight years.

George W. Bush (who congratulated Joe Biden for his victory the very day the TV networks called the presidential race for him) emphatically rejected the idea that the 2020 election was “stolen,” said the January 6 Capitol riot left him “sick to my stomach,” and dismissed Trumpism with the words: “History and the United States has shown these populist movements begin to fritter over time, and so I’m optimistic about democracy.”

W. went on to say he thought Biden was “off to a good start,” and professed himself “pleased” at the new president’s first couple of months in office. This is decidedly not a common sentiment among Republicans today. Nor is his outspoken support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which he manages to advocate without fulminating about border security. Indeed, Bush just published a new book about the immigrant experience in America, and wants the problems associated with the system to be depoliticized, which is hard to imagine after the last four years.

CNN’s Chris Cillizza read the interview and thought it was remarkable how far the GOP had drifted in the 12 years since Bush left office. But I think Cillizza is understating the significance of the gap between W. and Trump’s party. George W. Bush wasn’t just any old Republican: When nominated and elected in 2000, he was very much the candidate of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, the man who (as Robert Novak influentially put it) may have been the biological heir to George H.W. Bush but was the ideological heir of Ronald Reagan. He was backed in his unexpectedly difficult fight for the presidential nomination by every major figure in the conservative movement and in the Christian right. And until his popularity flagged during his second term, conservatives were pleased with his presidency; there wasn’t a peep of dissent from them when he ran for reelection in 2004.

When movement conservatives did have their occasional doubts about W., they often looked longingly at his younger brother, Jeb, considered the more intellectual and ideological of the two. But for the fact that W. won his 1994 gubernatorial race in Texas while Jeb lost his in Florida, Jeb would have probably been the dynastic candidate for president in 2000, and conservatives would not have needed any persuasion to get behind that idea. He was truly one of them.

Jeb didn’t suddenly turn RINO before or after Trump ran over him like a freight train from hell in 2016. If you read his tweets today, he’s still an enthusiastic fan of school choice (and a sworn enemy of teachers unions), and reflexively supports non-Trumpian Republicans at every turn. But he, too, denounced Trump’s efforts to contest the 2020 election, and after January 6 had this to say:

The President has provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol today. He has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection. Mr. President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy.

— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) January 7, 2021
Now some Trump defenders would say that the Bush brothers represented not so much “conservatism” but the “Establishment Republicanism” that meant too many compromises with liberals and too little commitment to “America First.” Others might concede the simple fact that in hundreds of particulars the Bushes reflected Reagan-style conservatism — but at the expense of the “populist” support Trump brought to the GOP.

What’s troubling, though, is that “conservatism” has suddenly been recast in Trump’s image. His most avid, idolatrous supporters are in the House Freedom Caucus, once the redoubt for House members who thought the House Republican Study Committee had become too squishy ideologically. The 2016 Trump rival who drew more movement conservative support than Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, has become a systematic Trump sycophant, and was one of the noisiest of the 2020 election coup participants. Anywhere in the GOP you look, the hard-right tradition seems now to run from Goldwater to Reagan to George W. Bush — and now to Trump.

It’s a disconnect, until you understand that Trump has transformed the conservative movement itself as much as he has transformed the party conservatives have dominated since the 1980s. Yes, there are old-school holdouts like some of the writers at National Review (when they aren’t in one of their anti-anti-Trump moods), and the more committed dissenters at the Bulwark and elsewhere. But even if the 45th president himself fades from sight, there’s a new weird cultural frenzy seizing conservatives. The ancient three-legged stool of free-market economics, national security toughness, and social conservatism is now off balance; today’s conservatives are preoccupied with “wokeness” and “cancel culture,” and a racist zest for law and order and closing the borders. All these themes have been evident in conservative Republican politics for many years, but not in this shrill and dominant form.

That these trends seem alien to George W. and Jeb Bush isn’t a sign of some finicky Establishment disdain for “populism” so much as it may reflect the death of their ideological tradition in the fiery crucible that gave birth to its replacement. If Trumpism begins clearly to outlast Trump, and if the Bush brothers increasingly sound like voices from a far-distant political planet, a decisive shift in what it means to be conservative could be an accomplished fact.

Social media itself isn’t all bad. In my humble opinion, the worst part is the algorithms created to “increase engagement” or to increase clicks, that tend to do the most damage.

These algorithms present a highly skewed picture of reality and create these “bubbles” where people are fed information, and interaction with others, that all serve to confirm their own biases. At the worst, the result is radicalization.

Well... he sort of gave his blessing. It was his usual talking in code to appeal to the radicals.

The reality is, it is the conservative media that wouod have to give their blessings. If conservative media didn't prop Trump up as some macho superior alpha male, then Trump would not even be on anyone's radar. If Tucker Carlson would turn around and say that liberals don't want you to get vaccinated and that there is a conspiracy from the liberals to kill conservative voters with the virus, the lines would be going out the door that day, even despite all the hoax talk.

On the great awakening they claim that as the press is so antiTrump they will proclaim the vaccine as evil and as the masses are brainwashed by the media they will stop taking the vaccine en masse and that’s how Trump will have saved America again , this time from the evil vaccine made by those demons Gates and Soros

The metric these days is not how conservative you are, but if you're willing to support Trump.

Joe Walsh, tea party conservative, the "if Hillary wins I'll grab my musket" guy, lost his radio show and political career paths because he opposes Trump.

Their base doesn’t want more taxes for the poor; they want to strip the poor of their benefits so they can pay less in taxes.

What their base don’t know is that they are the poor, and their leaders increase future taxes on the poor to make up for the deficits created by their own short-sighted legislation that they push while campaigning to attract single-issue voters, and the rich doesn’t get future taxes raised because then they’d stop donating, and the campaigns with the most money are the most successful.

Anywhere in the GOP you look, the hard-right tradition seems now to run from Goldwater to Reagan to George W. Bush — and now to Trump.

The GOP is, and has ever been, a race to the bottom. Whenever you say that things can't possibly get worse another steps up and says, "Challenge accepted." Then they drill down some more and achieve a new low.

This is evident by the bills (or lack thereof) they passed under Trump, and their resistance to HR1.

They know their politics and policies are so toxic their own base doesn't even support them. They have flat out admitted they won't be able to win elections in the long term without stealing them.

30% of America feels like a caricature of itself. Modern conservatism has turned into a faux-Christian death cult that worships capitalism and "freedom" (laws that apply to others but not their kind) over helping their neighbor because they're surrounded by billionaire and oligarch propaganda which has been working against the educational system and political system for decades.

Most people still seem to not know the definition of Socialism much less Communism.

Could you imagine if instead of Trump, one of the Koch brothers got into office in pursuit of money and power that they couldn't get in private industry? Or Jeff Bezos? Or Elon Musk?

Running the country like a business is the worst idea ever because the titans of industry are almost all the worst people ever.

That only works if you have something like Canada’s strict campaign financial laws.

Corporations aren’t people so they cannot donate money, only individual citizens can.

Individuals can donate a maximum $1650 to an individual candidate (but can donate that amount to as many candidates as they like)

They can donate another $1650 to a party (but can donate that amount to as many parties as they want (we have 5 official parties))

They can donate another $1650 to a party riding (but can donate that amount to as many party ridings as they want)

The can donate an additional $1650 to the party leader candidate (but can donate that amount to as many party leaders as they like).

So let’s say an individual wants to donate as much as they can to the most Right winged party the Progressive Conservative’s (PC’s) there are 338 ridings and each riding has a candidate, and one of the candidates is also running as the leader of the party. That is $1,133,100 maximum they can donate to the entire party and their candidates.

There are no PAC’s or dark money, no matter how rich you are that is the absolute maximum any individual citizen can donate to a single party and their candidates.

Oh and candidates can’t campaign outside of an election cycle which can only be a maximum 50 days long (and rarely exceeds 40 days). To which there are heavy penalties to candidates who do.

Our election system is enforced by the independent crown corporation Elections Canada not individual Provinces or Territories.

It’s one of the major reasons Canada is considered the 5th most free country in the World while the US sits at 15th.

Oh trust me, I would love campaign finance reform. My dream is to have fully public-funded campaigns, and bar private financing entirely.

There's a very easy way to do this without unreasonably restricting free speech.

Suppose we had a $6b public fund for campaign financing. This is a pool available to all registered campaigns. The pool is divided by giving each registered voter a "voucher" equal to the pool divided by the number of registered voters, so suppose it's $50 worth of "voter-bucks" that a citizen can choose to donate.

Each citizen could then donate any fraction of their $50 voter-bucks vouchers to whatever candidate they like, or no candidate at all. The candidates would be able to spend the voucher money on their campaign.

On paper that would give a single mother on public assistance the same political money-power as a billionaire.

Obviously there would be other fringe cases that would have to be barred, like giving people cushy jobs as "consultants" as payoffs after office, or lobbyist gifts, and other legalized bribes, but reforming the donations is a huge first step.

I don’t have to imagine that. You are actually describing the Canadian system.

So I outlined the maximum contribution an individual can donate, but each official party is also publicly funded based on how much they spend, and the number of registered party voters.

Public funding of Canada's federal political parties is allocated in two ways:

Per-vote subsidies allocated according to the votes of Canadians.

Electoral expense reimbursements - reimbursements allocated according to party spending during election periods.

The electoral expense reimbursement, which accounts for the largest part of the public financing following an election reimburses 50%-60% of a party's expenses on elections - the more a party spends during an election, the more public funds they get back.

This system gives freedom to the citizens to donate to which parties, ridings, and candidates they want while making the parties more dependent on the fair public funding model.

The more voters a party can sway to their party, and the more votes they can get increases their reimbursements from the public fund.

Oh and I should also mention that individual donations are also subsidized with tax credits which encourages individual donations. The tax credit is 75% on the first $400, 50% on the $401 to $750 and 33% above $750.

Since I turned 18 I’ve donated $400 every election because I get back $300 in my tax return but the party I donate to gets to keep the $400 which is a nice return investment on my $100

What makes it sadder is that there's no shortage of information showing how the rest of the world is. There's no excuse why we can't borrow ideas from countries that do better than us in some regards, to improve our own systems. And it's not like that information is censored or blocked off, like in more dictatorial and autocratic countries.

The power of propaganda can't be understated... But it's a wonder how the Conservative bubble manages to stay in tact with it's own ever-shifting stances, much less can't be penetrated by information contradictory to that.

Evangelicals are a heretical sect of Christianity which allows them to personally believe as they please regardless of how many thousands of years of religious text and opinion on any consensus, no matter how absurd.

The greatest example is that of evangelicals literally saying they would check in with trump before accepting the word of Jesus IN THE FLESH!

Tell me how this is not heretical? I’m waiting to here you evangelical opinion.

Oh- and they don’t have any loyalty to the US. They have loyalty to whatever helps them achieve their goals!

The Neo-Cons were thieving, war mongering liars but I never got the impression that they were actively trying to sabotage the US. Their ideology (simplified) was that great events (i.e. war) bring out the greatness of a nation and they wanted to see a return to the glory days of WW2 when everyone was joined in a cause and no one asked questions. 20 years later, we’re still paying the price for their absurd ideology.

However, with the current iteration of conservatives, I honestly think they have betrayed the country. They would rather ally with America’s enemies than work with their own fellow citizens. They would rather see the world burn than concede that they’ve been misguided. While I’m relieved that Biden won, I still despair that about 30-40% of the country would rather bumble toward fascism than critique their figurehead.

Economically it was more to the left than the GOP, at least on paper. They just focus on that one bit.

1930s fascism doesn't really fit with modern political divides.

The important thing is that the Nazis emerged as a rejection of traditional German conservatism. It's exactly what is going on now with the GOP.

I've been seeing people saying yesterday and today that Bush really wasn't that bad a guy, and really, when you come down to it, he was basically a moderate.

Does no one remember Jim Jeffords saying, "Fuck this, this Republican party has gone too crazy for me" and throwing the Senate to the Dems - and Bush and Cheney saying "good riddance?" Does no one remember him antagonizing our allies? Freedom fries? Claiming that he could lock up Americans indefinitely without charge? Torture? The modern surveillance state, so invasive that John Fucking Ashcroft said this shit wasn't okay and Bush had to overrule him?

Oh, and the million people Bush killed. People seem to have forgotten them, too, being all brown and over there in the Middle East and all. Out of sight, out of mind.

He was not a moderate. He was very conservative and a warhawk. Anywhere else in the world he would be far right.

Which is precisely why HR 1 is of utmost importance. We are about one or two elections away from authoritarian rule without it.

Anyone not on the Qult train is now a RINO by the deranged GOP standards today.

Reagan's stance on some things would warrant him also being considered too liberal now.

Reagan in 1984: "I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally..."

Heck, don't say it's a Reagan quote, and ask who would say it... Bet you they'd say some Socialist Commie scum,not knowing that it was a man whose administration saw the fall of Communism.

The republican party is nothing more than a band of hyper-exclusionary, malignant, psychopaths. With nothing more to defend their positions than "I know you are, but what am I" in some form or another.

Why on earth would even lords of edge think that shit is cool is beyond me.

If you don't have a hood in your closet or a swastika on your arm, you are too liberal for the GQP.

We need to stop calling the current GOP “conservative” and start calling it radicalized, fundamentalist, reactionary, or something similar. There’s nothing conservative in what they do.

It does make me sad when I see people pretending that W was anything besides a horrible President responsible for 100s of thousands of deaths and endless wars. And yet suddenly not attempting to lead a coup against your own country is enough to be considered a statesman.

Right? The problem isn't that he's too liberal, he just isn't enough of a neo-fascist.

George W Bush is a war criminal and should die in prison.

He fabricated evidence to lie to congress for war authorization. He destabilized Iraq while killing hundreds of thousands of people. He created ISIS.

The guy who illegally started a war with Iraq.

The guy who approved torture as policy.

The guy whose words inspired thousands of acts of violence against anyone even closely resembling a Muslim person.

The guy who gutted schools by having them close if too many students failed a standardized test.

The guy who routed government money to religious organizations under the "faith based initiative".

The guy who impede stem cell research by banning embryonic stem cell research. 1

The guy who banned late term abortions and denied funding to groups who provided abortions overseas.

The guy who introduced the massive, ever present surveillance apparatus that is storing what I am writing and records every phone call and records all domestic internet traffic.

This is the guy who is too liberal.

Fuck off.

1 I know the specifics were "new embryonic stem cells" but there's still consequences as a result of that ban.

I remember reading somewhere that Dubya was one of the few Republicans back in the day to support any kind of immigration reform. The Qanon crowd probably considers him a Democrat based on that alone.
