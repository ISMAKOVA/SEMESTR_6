Nearly one-third of Republican voters believe that GOP lawmakers in Congress backed President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan—even though not a single Republican voted for the massive relief legislation.

The American Rescue Plan—which included $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans, shored up unemployment benefits and significantly expanded the child tax credit—passed in the House and Senate on straight party-line votes. Republican senators and representatives vocally opposed the legislation, arguing it was too costly, not targeted enough and doled out too much funding unrelated to the current crisis. But a sizable portion of GOP voters somehow missed that staunch opposition.

A new poll conducted by Data for Progress and Vox asked GOP voters if Republicans in Congress backed the $1.9 trillion package. While the majority (53 percent) of Republican voters knew correctly that their party's lawmakers did not back Biden's relief plan, 31 percent said that they had. An additional 17 percent of GOP voters said they did not know.

By comparison, just 16 percent of Democratic voters and 16 percent of independent voters said that Republican lawmakers supported the legislation.

Before passage of the American Rescue Plan, polling showed that it was widely popular across party lines, despite no support for it from Republican lawmakers. Polling by Morning Consult and Politico conducted in late February showed that more than three-quarters (76 percent) of voters supported the legislation. That included 89 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of independents and 60 percent of Republicans.

Separate polling by CNN from earlier this month found that the key provisions of the bill were broadly popular as well. The expanded tax credits for families were backed by 85 percent of Americans, while 76 percent supported the $1,400 stimulus checks.

NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >
Although no Republican lawmakers voted in favor of the bill, some publicly touted key provisions of the package following its passage. This drew some backlash from Democrats, who argued that GOP members of Congress were attempting to take credit for something they did not accomplish.

"Independent restaurant operators have won $28.6 billion worth of targeted relief. This funding will ensure small businesses can survive the pandemic by helping to adapt their operations and keep their employees on the payroll," Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, tweeted following the bill's passage.

Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, called out GOP colleagues for promoting parts of the legislation that they did not support.

"You know how in a group project there is always a handful of students who didn't contribute but they still take credit at the end. That's the GOP after the passage of the American Rescue Plan," Tlaib tweeted on March 14.

Let's be real, tons of people are uninformed on both sides. It does seem like being uninformed is a requirement to support the Republicans though. Either that or very strongly believe that the ends justify the means, and have really terrible opinions about what is best for the country and its people.

It’s even worse than the headline. Another 17% said they didn’t know. So that’s close to 50% of the polled group admitting they have no idea what’s going on but register and vote Republican anyway.

It's even worse than that. A portion of the voters who answered correctly were just guessing, and of the Republicans that actually knew, a significant portion of them support the votes against.

They’re Republicans: all this tells you is that they are a tribe, not a political party. The pollsters are asking the wrong questions. What they should ask is “would your vote change based on what republican lawmakers vote or not vote on?” The answer is no. They vote for the tribe.

The should print the vote counts on the $1400 checks. I know it wouldn't do much directly, since it's an automatic process in most states, but the more news channels report on it the better.

That’s not surprising . A lot of Republican voters just care about culture wars and wedge issues and don’t follow most of the politic news when it comes to government functionality, bills, policy ect , and it’s been that way even long before the whole “cancel culture” burst in the main stream the last month

By definition, Republican voters are not the most informed group of voters nor are they known for caring about the truth too much.

So yeah, they will continue thinking whatever they want or whatever Facebook or Faux News tell them to think and they will vote (R) again, no matter who's on the ticket.

I remember in 2016 talking to a woman and they said to me "well if he can run this country like he runs his business then things should be great..." Immediately followed by "... But I don't know I don't really pay that much attention to it."

So within the same statement you acknowledge you're naive and still give your opinion...

Never mind the fact he has ran his businesses both like shit and unethically. Imagine being so unsuccessful WHILE foregoing basic ethics.

And a country isn't a fucking business. The largest businesses like Walmart have 2.2 million employees. Is 350 million lives the same as that, NO!

Biden needs to go at his State of the Union and call this out.

"Congress passed and I signed this year the largest relief bill in American history for the American people. It was passed entirely by Democratic votes and not a single Republican voted yes for this bill. Not a single Republican voted to send you the $1400 check you used to buy gas for your car, pay rent or your mortgage. Not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for this package. The differences between the Democratic party and the Republican party could not be more clear. The Democratic party is for the working people of America. The Republican party is for the elite."

I mean, the fact that no Republican supported the stimmy is widely being discussed by Democratic politicians, and was widely reported when the bill passed. The people who don't know this, either don't want to know, or really aren't paying any attention at all. Either way, they're not going to be listening to Bidens State of the Union.

Never gonna say that, especially at a state of the union. His message has consistently been all about unity. Your proposed message, while 100% true, cannot be said by Biden. He needs attack dogs for this instead (not Harris either - she needs to tow the same line until 2024).

Oh, it’s my cue!

In the you-can’t-make-up-this-stuff department, here’s what the Republican Party of Texas wrote into its 2012 platform as part of the section on education:

Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.

Yes, you read that right. The party opposes the teaching of “higher order thinking skills” because it believes the purpose is to challenge a student’s “fixed beliefs” and undermine “parental authority.”

Texas GOP rejects ‘critical thinking’ skills. Really.

We really need to start teaching critical thinking skills in our schools.

I know this is reddit's go-to response, but the UK has people burning down 5G towers, France has the highest percent of anti-vaxxers in the world, homeopathy still has considerable cachet in Germany, Japan is falling into Qanon, and even in the most developed parts of the Middle East public opinion might best be described as "schizophrenic."

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink. Schools already teach critical thinking in a variety of ways, but most people don't remember even 10% of what they learned in school.

What we really need are ongoing anti-fascist, anti-snakeoil, and pro-science public service announcements a la this and this and this. I don't know how best to straddle the line between keeping the public informed and able to critically think vs. outright propaganda or "right-think" (a la "Xi Jinping thought"), but throwing some knowledge at kids and hoping it sticks for the rest of their lives has really proven to be inadequate everywhere. Learning and a state of learnedness is really a lifelong endeavor that people need to keep up from time to time, and policy should reflect that in some way.

More to the point, at least a third of Republican voters would go right on voting for anyone with an (R) following their name even if they saw them 1st hand doing everything QAnon claims the Hollywood elite and Democratic politicians do with young children.

In the age of tribal politics, Republicans can do no wrong and Democrats can do no good from the perspective of true Republican voters. Probably unnecessary to add, but I'm a stickler for completeness, no amount of evidence or logic could budge a true Republican from whatever fantastical beliefs such a specimen of humanity would refuse to release even from cold, dead fingers.

They're everywhere, just far from majorities in some places.

Visit Redding or Yuba City, California, and you'll find plenty of unregenerate Trumpistas. Heck, most of California an hour's drive from the Ocean is politically indistinguishable from Idaho or Tennessee. For that matter, Del Norte, southern Monterrey, San Luis Obispo, and northern San Diego county close to the ocean are also ruby red.

Third of Republican Voters Think

Let me just stop you right there. Authoritarians don't think; they conform, they follow, they obey, they fall prey to the manipulations of their leaders, they feel, they react, Conservatives are from the amygdala, liberals are from the anterior cyngulate cortex. Conservatives live by the lizard brain, liberals live by the limbic system.

As someone who use to vote Republican and struggles to understand how I was an idiot for so long ...

Republican behavior is so beyond the pale that, when you describe their behavior accurately, you sound hyperbolic and emotional. Their behavior is so comical that it’s hard to convince their followers that it’s real. It must be a liberal exaggeration. Or you must confront that your entire political belief system is wrong and that you’re gullible, despite defining liberals as the gullible ones.

They don't think that. They don't "think" much at all.

About a third of any selected population will back the craziest most authoritarian lunatic they can find. They live in the state of perpetual fear, and it scares them to have to think on their own. So they would rather not think at all. Which is why they either select the craziest most ridiculous answer they can find, or select something at random. They are simply angry that you even bothered to call them and are annoyed at your presence (why can't you just let them die in peace?!) So they pick whatever just to piss you off and that's how you get surveys that say "1/3 of the population believes the Earth is a hexagon and MLK did 9/11." Double points if you can frame a question to sound like something they are vaguely afraid of that they may have heard on Fox or OAN or AM Radio.

See, the promise of a fascist, authoritarian, or tyrannical leader is the promise that you're thinking will be done for you. All you need to know is who to hate and who to attack. All that fancy shit infrastructure, budgeting, taxes, technology, foreign relations, budgeting, etc. will be done for you by a tough guy who takes no gruff and tells it how it is. As long as you have someone you can be afraid of they will direct your anger at them and keep you safe from them at the same time. Policy? Don't worry about it. We got it. You just worry about the illegal alien running across your farmland with calves the size of cantaloupes carrying drugs and kidnapping children for QAnon masters.

Sort of. They supported major changes, including reducing the stimulus from $2k to $1.4k, then voted against it anyway. If that sounds familiar it’s what the GOP did with Obamacare.

The stupid GOP is in a win win situation. They tell their stupid constituents that they are not gonna vote for a “socialist plan” “a budget we can’t afford” and say they’re are gonna fight it tooth and nail knowing that it will pass because the Democrats have the majority and in the end their constituents are taken care of and they look “strong” for fighting against it. Pisses me off!

It was popular on both sides. The republican representatives don’t actually vote what their constituents want...... it’s more imported to be a thorn in the side of good. If the republicans had good ideas, they wouldn’t have to cheat so much.

I knew the republicans were supported by the less educated, but stop watching brainwash news. Check out reality sometime!

I thought for sure my phone would be going crazy all week with notifications about how the Treasury was being bombarded with returned stimulus checks from Republican voters standing in solidarity with the people they voted for ... you know 'to send a powerful message'..

Guess not. Funny thing is, I dont hear any of them thanking Democrats for the free money that not a single one of their own Republican representatives voted in favor of them getting.

The hypocrisy is off the charts.

I think the biggest frustration is that... there are some that will acknowledge reality. Will acknowledge that there are problem within the party. Will acknowledge that some of the policies they are pushing they do not want or care for.

... And they will still vote (R) on the ballot every single time, regardless of who it is attached to.

So, whenever these magazines/newspapers/sources say “some big percentage of REPUBLICANS xyz and abc,” they’re just trying to scare you. The reality is, less than 30% of the eligible voter population registers Republican (not far from those that register democrat).

This headline is saying 1/3 of the 30% of the eligible voters who register Republican think that republicans voted for the relief bill. Yes, that’s still a lot of people, don’t get me wrong, but nobody thought they were going to convince the fanatical cult of Trump to love Biden, so really this headline just says:

The worst 1/3 of 30% don’t do anything to improve the quality of their knowledge, will not do anything to do so, and will continue to believe whatever they’re told. We already knew this. It shouldn’t shock or scare anyone...

I imagine the numbers are even similar for democrats who are on the loudest and most virulent end of the political party (not a big comparison there though, IMO) since extremists exist on both sides.
